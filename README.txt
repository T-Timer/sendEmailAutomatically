												|
Welcome to the auto send email application. 	|
												|
------------------------------------------------|

Please read this before using the application.

------------------------------------------------|
Introduction and instructions					|
------------------------------------------------|


This application composes and send an email at a time specified by the user, without the need to access gmail client. 

Because this application is an external source and remotely accesses your gmail account, by default Gmail won't allow external sources to access the account. 

Therefore before we can use this application, you need to allow this application to have remote access to your Gmail account. To enable Gmail account access from external sources, please follow these steps: 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Gmail account -> Settings -> Security -> Less secure app access -> On		|
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


How to open the application: Double click on	 sendMail.bat	 file
Some notes: 
The mail won't be sent if you:

1) Get the username or password wrong
2) Have no text in the message body
3) Your date or time does not exist. E.g: setting month = 20 or setting hour = 50

That's all from me. Please enjoy the application!
